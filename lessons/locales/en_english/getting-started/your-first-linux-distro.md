Your First Linux Distro
=======================

Where to begin?  You can begin wherever you want, but I might suggest a Debian-based distribution, to start.  Fortunately, there are many.  Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Elementary OS (if you're into Mac's), just to name some of the popular ones.  If you're into gaming, Ubuntu is well-supported (it is the de-facto Linux distribution for game developers; it's the target they build for when they want to say their games work on Linux).  

A word to the wise:  Don't get too hung up on software freedom just yet-- there's plenty of time for that down the road.  For now, figure out what works for you-- and if that means proprietary drivers, so be it (you can always upgrade to an AMD card down the road...).
