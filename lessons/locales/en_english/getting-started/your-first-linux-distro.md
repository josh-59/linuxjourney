Your First Linux Distro
=======================

Where to begin?  You can begin wherever you want, but I might suggest Debian-based distributions, to start.  Fortunately, there are many.  Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Elementary OS (if you're into Mac's), just to name some of the popular ones.

A word to the wise:  Don't get too hung up on software freedom just yet-- there's plenty of time for that down the road.  For now, figure out what works for you-- and if that means proprietary drivers, so be it (you can always upgrade to an AMD card down the road...).
