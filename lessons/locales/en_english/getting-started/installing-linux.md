`iso` files
-----------

An `iso` file is an [image of a disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_image), nothing more.  To create one, you'd make a disk *just* so, and then copy it, byte-for-byte, to a file.  Such a file has the benefit of being *known good:* If the disk was ship-shape when you imaged it, and the file is perfectly intact, then a disk with that file copied onto it (again, byte-for-byte) is also ship-shape.  

Thus, there are three steps to creating a bootable medium:

1) Download the iso of your choosing 
2) Verify its integrity 
3) Copy it to some boot medium.
