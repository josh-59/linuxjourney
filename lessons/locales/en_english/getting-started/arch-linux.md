Arch Linux
==========

Overview
--------

Arch is a lightweight and flexible Linux distribution driven 100% by the community.  Arch uses a rolling release model, and so offers the latest version of each piece of software.  As a user, you install the distribution once, then use their package manager (`pacman`) to update the software you've chosen to install, as those updates are released to the public.  You really need to get your hands dirty to understand the system and its functions, but in turn you get complete and total control of your system.

Package Management
------------------

It uses its own package manager, `pacman`, to install, update and manage packages. Some interesting commands:  `pacman -Ql [package]` will list the files owned by a given package.  `pacman Qo [file]` asks the package manager, "Who owns the file `file`?"  

Configurability
---------------
If you want a lightweight operating system and really want to understand Linux, use Arch! There’s a bit of a learning curve, but for the hardcore Linux users, this is a great choice.

Uses
----

Great for desktop and laptop. If you also have a small device such as a Raspberry Pi and need to stick a lightweight OS on it, you can’t go wrong with [Arch Linux ARM](https://archlinuxarm.org/).

Arch Wiki
---------

The Arch Wiki deserves a section unto itself-- it, like the distribution itself, is 100% communit-driven, and like the distribution, what it offers is excellent.  I like to think of each page as "notes" on a given subject.  For example, there's a page dedicated to [installing Arch](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide), and what it contains are, essentially, notes on the subject.
